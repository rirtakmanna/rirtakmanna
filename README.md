# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, Iâ€™m Rirtak

![Cover](/Cover.png)

I'm a web designer and developer. I love creating websites that resonate and connect with the target audiences. I spend my entire day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc. It's my mission is to design the digital world in a new way.
<br>I am a commerce student cleverly disguised as a web developer. My knowledge for business helps me to understand the market, which ultimately helps me to strategize for website design. Which eventually helps my Client to reach their target audience.
